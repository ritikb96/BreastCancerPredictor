# BreastCancerPredictor
This project aims to classify breast tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn.

We applied machine learning models, including Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with 3 and 10 neighbors, to evaluate classification performance.

The models were assessed using confusion matrix, ROC curve, cumulative response, and lift curve to ensure accurate and reliable predictions for early detection.

##Positive class (1) → Benign (Non-cancerous)
##Negative class (0) → Malignant (Cancerous)in.
